   - **Note**: App will work without emails, but notifications are disabled

2. **"Email transporter verification failed"**
   - **Check**: Gmail account has 2FA enabled
   - **Check**: App password is exactly 16 characters (no spaces)
   - **Check**: Using correct Gmail address

3. **"Authentication failed" SMTP Error**
   - **Solution**: Generate a new App Password
   - **Check**: Using the app password, not your regular Gmail password
   - **Check**: Account hasn't been locked or restricted

4. **Emails Not Arriving**
   - **Check**: Spam/junk folders
   - **Check**: Gmail account storage isn't full
   - **Test**: Send a test email from Gmail web interface
   - **Verify**: Recipient email address is correct

### Debug Mode:
Enable detailed email logging by checking server console output:
```
Creating email transporter with Gmail SMTP
Email user: your-email@gmail.com
Password length: 16
Email server is ready to send messages
```

### Without Email Configuration:
The application works perfectly without email setup:
- All order functionality remains operational
- Orders are created and tracked normally
- Admin can manage orders through dashboard
- Customers can track orders via Order Status page
- Email notifications are simply skipped with warning logs

## Production Considerations

For production deployment:
1. Use a dedicated business email account
2. Consider email service providers like SendGrid, Mailgun, or AWS SES for higher volume
3. Set up proper SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records for better deliverability
4. Monitor email delivery rates and bounce handling
5. Implement email templates with your actual business branding
